# Regression with a Tabular Paris Housing Price Dataset competition 
details about the competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e6/overview
This was one of my first attempts to solve a Kaggle competition,
in It, I used the following libraries:
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Data

The data used was separated into two files:

* Train dataset (`train.csv`)
* Test dataset (`test.csv`)

they can be found and downloaded at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e6/data
